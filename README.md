# GPS_PROJECT

## Objective:
- On reaching the final destination, the GREEN led is turned on.

## Bonus:
- when the target destination is far away by distance > 5 meters , the RED led will turn on.
- When the target destination is about to be reached < 5 meters , the BLUE led will turn on.

## What we used ?
- Tiva TM4C123GH6PM Microcontroller based on ARM Cortex-M4.
- GPS Module.

## Algorithm :
- Getting the current location from GPS Module using UART, then calculating the distance between it and final location which is hard coded inside the code.
- Based on the distance we choose which led to turn on.
